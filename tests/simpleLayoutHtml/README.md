In the first task you need to create a simple layout using the elements you've just learned.

Create two paragraphs with random text and a bulleted list of two elements. Insert a hyperlink in the first bullet. The actual path of the link is not important. You specify an empty path with #. This allows you to make the user stay on the same page, rather than redirect him to another page.

The text in paragraph 2.

The first bullet with a hyperlink
